## Here we are conneting one server to another without password


       **Turn ON both the server**
          On server1 run 
	     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096                           # -t rsa is used for the encruyption type and -b 4096 is for the secuirity
	  Here you will get a ssh public key and private key     # do not share the private key
	  scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server2:/home/user/	 # here you are sending the public key which got downloaded in home of server1 and sending it to home directory of server2 using scp

       **Now go to server2**
          create a directory for moving the public key
	     mkdir -p ~/.ssh     				 # creating an hidden directory
	     cat ~/id.rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorised_keys		 #simply moved the key which was in home to hidden directory which we created
	     rm ~/id_rsa.pub					 #remove the original file
	     chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys			 #set permissions so that no one can access it.

	**In the server1**
	     ssh user@server2 					 #you will have to enter user@server2 IP address
	     Now you will be able to login to the sevrer2 without needing of the password.


     ##Optional: Disable Password Authentication (For Security)
           One server2 edit the ssh config file
	        vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
				PasswordAuthentication no
				PermitRootLogin no

		save it and restart the service
		    service sshd restart
